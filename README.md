# days-until

Are you annoyed that there are no simple tools out there to tell you how many days are until a certain date?
I was too, until I discovered the `days-until` tool!

`days-until` allows you to enter a date and count down the days to it. 
Maybe it's a date that you can't wait for, or maybe it's a date that you dread.
In any case, `days-until` is always there for you to tell how many days are until then.

What's more, `days-until` remembers the date you last typed in using browser cookies.
That means you don't have to re-enter the date again every time you visit the page.
Isn't that exciting?

I love the `days-until` tool, and so should you!
